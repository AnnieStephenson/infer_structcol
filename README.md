# infer_structcol

infer_structcol
--------

This is a package created for the PHY 201 class, Spring of 2017 at Harvard University. It uses bayesian inference to estimate parameters of structural color samples made out of colloidal packings. It imports the structcol package to do scattering calculations. It includes a generative model to account for experimental uncertainties such as the effect of sample chambers on the reflectance spectra of structurally-colored samples. 

This package uses the structural-color package to calculate reflectance spectra using a single scattering model. Before you install the infer_structcol package, you will need to git clone or download the structural-color package from https://github.com/manoharan-lab/structural-color and copy the structcol directory into the root directory of your infer-structcol package.
